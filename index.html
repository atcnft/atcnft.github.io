    <p>@CNFT is a revolutionary Cardano NFT protocol that adds utility to any nft collection by providing a way to identify a NFT holding wallet address through combing the collection and NFT names with "@" and "#" signs.</p>

    <details>
      <summary>How much does it cost?</summary>
      <p>XX ADA per @CNFT per policy - one time payment. TBD</p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>What are the tools that support @CNFT?</summary>
      <p>
        TBA
      </p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>What is the process to register an @CNFT to my collection?</summary>
      <p>
        The process simply is;<br/>
        (1) Registration -> (2) Verification -> (3) Mint<br/><br/>

        Where;<br/>
        (1) Registration Request: Collection/policy owner is expected to fill <a target="_blank" href="https://forms.zohopublic.com/atcnft/form/CNFTRegistrationRequest/formperma/lUJz9rYIHsXJj2MulM7g7_NfQdPNDfvk3yVd9jWcYuc">this form</a>,<br/><br/>

        (2) Verification: We will conduct a simple verification process through the provided collection details and contact information. Essentially, and after verifiying the collection itself, we will verify that the founder/owner issued this request,<br/><br/>

        (3) Mint: We will provide a link to mint your @CNFT. Once the transaction is completed, you will receive your @CNFT as a NFT in the specified wallet.<br/><br/>
        
        <small>* The expected time to complete the above process depends on the volume of applicants. We aim to conclude any application in 24H.</small>
      </p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>Are @CNFTs case sensitive?</summary>
      <p>Yes! ABCD is NOT same as abcd, to support both, they should be minted separately.</p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>Is there any guideline when picking a @CNFT name for my collection?</summary>
      <p>
        Initially, it should be inspired and derived from the collection name with unique alphanumeric characters only. Whitespaces are valid.<br/><br/>
        Some samples (assuming the picked @CNFT is not already taken):
        <table class="details-table">
          <thead>
            <tr>
              <th>Collection Name</th>
              <th>@CNFT</th>
              <th></th>
            </tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <td>Awsome ABCD</td>
              <td>Awsome ABCD</td>
              <td class="ok-color">Valid</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Awsome ABCD</td>
              <td>ABCD</td>
              <td class="ok-color">Valid</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Awsome ABCD</td>
              <td>AB!CD</td>
              <td class="ng-color">Invalid</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Awsome ABCD</td>
              <td>AABCD</td>
              <td class="ok-color">Valid</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Awsome ABCD</td>
              <td>XYZ</td>
              <td class="ng-color">Invalid</td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>

    » General<br/>

    <details>
      <summary>Who are you?</summary>
      <p>
        The founder is an engineer, owner of two tech companies and a Cardano enthusiast with 17+ years of experience.<br/>
        We aim to dox ourselves once we move to a crypto friendly land!
      </p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>Why are you doing the registration process in a centralized way?</summary>
      <p>
        The protocol itself is onchain. We are rolling out the verification and registration service to assert intial proper adoption.<br/>
        Afterwards, minting new @CNFTs will be automated without restrictions through smart contracts.<br/>
        Furthermore, our aim is to transfer the ownership of the protocol to the community eventually. 
        It is still early at this stage to provide the "when and how" details, however, we will 
        release a whitepaper for that purpose once the protocol matures and acquires proper adoption.<br/>
      </p>
